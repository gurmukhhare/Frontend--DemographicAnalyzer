This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This repository contains the code for the front-end of DemoMe, a web app that is able to predict age, gender, and cultural appearence based on the images the user uploads. Users can sign in or register and DemoMe will track their total number of attempts. The front end is implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the React Framework.
